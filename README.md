TRAFFIC VIOLATION

      Data - https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Public-Safety/Traffic-Violations/4mse-ku6q
      
      PART A
      
      1. Load all the data (1 or more files) into Pandas using the appropriate format.
      2. Plot the data accordingly
          A - Plot a histogram for Violation Type
          B - Group by Location and plot the Number of Violations for the period 2013 to 2015
          C - Plot the aggregated Number of Violations first by District followed by Race (Refer to Stacked Bar Charts)
          
      PART B
      
      Study the data and create a series of plots to justify an analysis of a proposed story.
